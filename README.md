# Date Calculator App

This web application allows users to calculate the end date by entering a start date and specifying the number of days. It can be used for various purposes, such as calculating due dates for invoices by adding a specific number of days to an order date.

## Features

- Input a start date and the number of days to get the end date.
- Select predefined periods from a dropdown (e.g., 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, or months).
- The app ensures that only one input method is used at a time (either entering days manually or selecting from the dropdown).
- Useful for scenarios like invoice processing, where the due date is calculated based on the number of days after an order or issue date.

## Example Use Case

For businesses handling invoices, this app can be used to easily calculate the payment due date. For example, if an invoice is issued on a specific date, the user can add the number of days until payment is due, and the app will provide the final due date.
